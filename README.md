# Maia-DiscordBot

Small personal project made to learn .NET Core.
Bot has basic functionality such as ability to play audio, self-updates, random games and more.

# Installation
It works both on Windows and Linux.
If you wish to run bot on Linux, make sure to install .NET Core runtime or SDK first.
I've included a script for runtime installation into the bot so you can use it if you don't want to install it on your own.

If you wish to download bot and host it on your own device, here you can download latest release:
